# Algorithms

## Week Two

Learned and gave examples of constant, linear, and quadratic BigO notations


## Week Five

Learned how to implement a Fisher-Yates shuffle to randomize the song lyrics inputted from a file

## Week Eight

Created four different types of data structures: maps, arrays, queues, and stacks. Maps are structures that use a key value storage type. These are best for sets of information that have one element that correlates to another such as a first and last name. Arrays are similar to lists and are better for singular data (1D) or data that are similar to a grid style (2D) such as a grocery list or a graph. Queues use a first-in, first-out method and are more useful for items where old information needs to be stored for a long time. Stacks use a last-in, first-out method and are more useful when newer information doesn't need to be stored for long such as when a person updates their address- the new address is more important than the one before it.

## Week Eleven

Created six different algorithms for sorting and described them, provided pseudocode and compared their run time, and summarized which is most efficient.

## Week Twelve

Created three different algorithms for searching and described them, provided pseudocode and compared their run time, and summarized which is most efficient.

## Week Fourteen

Added a tree structure with the data from the provided list.
